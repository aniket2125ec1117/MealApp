# MealApp

MealApp is a Flutter-based mobile application developed to help users find and organize meal recipes. This project was undertaken as a learning exercise to understand how to navigate through different pages in Flutter and to implement state management using Riverpod.

## Description

In this project, I learned how to:

- Navigate through different pages using Flutter's `Navigator` and `Routes`.
- Implement state management using Riverpod.

### Navigation

Flutter's `Navigator` is used to move between different pages (or screens) in the app. This involves pushing and popping routes off the navigation stack. I learned how to:

- Define routes in the `MaterialApp` widget.
- Use `Navigator.push` to navigate to a new page.
- Use `Navigator.pop` to return to the previous page.

### Riverpod

Riverpod is a provider-based state management solution for Flutter. It is designed to be a simpler, more robust alternative to Provider. Through this project, I learned how to:

- Set up Riverpod in a Flutter project.
- Create and use providers to manage state.
- Use `ConsumerWidget` and `Consumer` to listen to and react to state changes.
